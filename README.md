# Explainable-MultiHopGNN
This repository aims to explore the explainability of Multi-Hop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through empirical evaluation and analysis. It addresses the growing interest in making complex GNN models more interpretable, focusing on their ability to explain the rationale behind predictions across multiple hops.
